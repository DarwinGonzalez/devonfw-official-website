== Getting started with devonfw

=== devonfw introduction

devonfw, the devonfw platform. This is a product of the CSD industrialization effort to bring a standardized platform for custom software development within Capgemini APPS2. This platform is aimed at engagements where clients do not force the use of a determined technology so we can offer a better alternative coming from our experience as a group.
devonfw is a development platform aiming for standardization of processes and productivity boost, that provides an architecture blueprint for Java/JavaScript applications, alongside a set of tools to provide a fully functional out-of-the-box development environment.

* First things first. If youÂ´re a developer just starting with devonfw, you should have a look at the devonfw guide. It serves as an entry point and reference document for everything related to devonfw.
+
{nbsp}
+
You can use the devonfw Console, devcon, to help you with many automated tasks around the full life-cycle of devonfw applications, from installing the basic working environment and generating a new project, to running a test server and deploying an application to production, devcon is the easiest way to use devonfw.

* If you`re an experienced hand, like a senior developer or architect, you should add the devon4J guide.
+
{nbsp}
+
devonfw uses devon4J as lean open source architecture blueprint for the server side of an application. devon4J offers you a comprehensive documentation for building your application. Stop with digging in the docs of many different open source projects in parallel, getting on the wrong track or lost in space.
