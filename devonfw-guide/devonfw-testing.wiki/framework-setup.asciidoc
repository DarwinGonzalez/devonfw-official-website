== Starting the IDE

. Use the script "start-eclipse.bat" to run the Eclipse IDE.
. When running the IDE for the first time, a project called "allure-app-under-test" should already be imported as default. If not however, it can be re-imported manually.
. Click on File -> Import -> "Existing Maven Projects"
+

. When being prompted for the Project "Root Folder", select "allure-app-under-test". It's located at:
+
_your_extracted_framework/workspace/allure-app-under-test_
+
Finally, select check the _pom.xml_ and click on finish to import the project.

After the project was successfully imported, you should be greeted with the familiar Eclipse interface.
