Mr Checker installation can be done in three ways:

* *Easy out of the box installation* - Fast and easy solution - recommended for all users, who had previously not used any test automation environment. A drawback of these solutions is that it applies not for all Operation Systems
* *Out of the box installation* - with additional steps - when the first way is not working for you
* *Advanced installation* - Manual step by step installation containing all framework ingredients
